This script is pretty basic and provincial in nature for my league. 
I'm using a spreadsheet at the moment to calculate projection consensus and 
standard deviation (which is also used to derive upper and lower limits and 
some other things not necessarily in this script yet).

TODO:

- Parse options from command line
- Import projections from CSV
- Calculate Consensus mean and standard deviation in script
- Add positions
- Calculate optimal lineups
- If projected to lose, calculate lineup with greatest upside
