This script is pretty basic and provincial in nature for my league. 
I'm using a spreadsheet at the moment to gather projection consensus 
(which is also used to derive upper and lower limits and 
some other things not necessarily in this script yet).

TODO:

- Add positions
- Add support for final scores in CSV files
- Calculate optimal lineups
- If projected to lose, calculate lineup with greatest upside
- Support for running multiple matchups in the league
- Support for multiple leagues 
- Archive matchup CSVs for analysis
